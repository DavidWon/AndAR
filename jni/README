AndAR native sources

The AndAR project uses some native libraries in order to do time consuming stuff.
It uses sources from: ARToolkit, Android Open Source Project, simclist

Steps needed to compile the native sources:
   1. Install the android NDK
   2. (windows only) Install Cygwin
   3. Open the Cygwin shell or some other shell on a linux system
   4. Go to the NDK folder.
          * This is where you unzipped the android NDK.
          * e.g. you unzipped it to C:\cygwin do a cd /android-ndk. 
   5. Create a symlink from your eclipse project folder (should be called AndOpenGLCam) to the ndk apps folder, e.g. ln -s /cygdrive/c/Users/Tobi/workspace/AndAR/ apps/AndAR (adapt the path)
   6. In the root of the NDK folder run make APP=AndOpenGLCam
   7. Refesh your project in Eclipse (right-click -> refresh)
   8. If everything went smoothly your libs folder should contain .so files 
   
The AR folder contains anything ARToolkit specific, whereas the image_processing folder contains everything concerning color space conversion.
The glue between Java an C is provided by the file AR/arToolkit.c.(regarding the ARToolkit)   

The file arGl.c had to be modified, as opengl on android only supports float matrices.

The file AR/ar.h contains a preprocessing define called DEBUG_LOGGING, which en/disables logging messages for debug purposes. Should be turned off before production releases.
