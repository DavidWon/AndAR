 * There are different reasons, why an AndARException may occur.

 * Nevertheless they should be catched, so that the user might be informed.
 * If they occur they are rather severe, which means the library doesn't work. 
 * Therefor they inherit from RuntimeExecptions.
 * This also means, that they may be thrown at any time.
